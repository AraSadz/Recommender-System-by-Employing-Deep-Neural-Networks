# Recommender-System-by-Employing-Deep-Neural-Networks

In this project we have used the MovieLens 100K Dataset for training a recommender system.

We developed a content-based recommender system using Deep Neural Networks (NN).

The recommender system comprises two NNs, one is used to extract the item's (movies) feature and the other one is employed to extract the user's features. Then the output of the recommender is constructed based on the dot product of the users' and items' features.

 In addition to the details related to the recommender system, we have also provided the data cleansing and feature engineering to enhance the model.
